Week 6 Assignment: Build a Cookie Clicker using React
Overview
It’s time for some more cookies. The Cookie Clicker game from previous weeks as a React application. It’s useful to build the same application in the new paradigm so you can draw direct comparisons and see how the new approach is different from the old one.

React requires a slightly different way of thinking than plain HTML and JavaScript, but it’s the same technologies under the hood. The main differences are - surprise, surprise - in the way what is being displayed by your components reacts to changes in the data, rather than manually updating the DOM ourselves.

Instructions
User Stories
🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that the user’s interactions with the app are smooth and their data is managed effectively.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to manage game time with setInterval, return a cleanup function, and use a dependency array so that the game runs efficiently and updates in real-time for the user.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.
🐿️ As a user, I want the application to automatically update the game state every second so that I can see my progress and earned cookies in real time, making the game more exciting and rewarding.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the .map() function to render lists of items efficiently so that the user can see dynamic content without performance issues.
🐿️ As a user, I want to purchase upgrades with my earned cookies to increase my cookies per second, making the gameplay more rewarding.
Requirements
🎯 Implement the useState hook.
🎯 Use useEffect effectively.
🎯 Return JSX from a source other than App.jsx, for example, by using components.
🎯 Apply setInterval to execute periodic tasks within the application.
🎯 Use the .map() function to render lists of items in the application dynamically.
🎯 Use logic to manage the purchase and application of upgrade items within the game.

Required reflections

1. I acheived all requirements that have been set including the strecth goals to the best of my ability
2. I attempted all stretch goals and feel that this is an accurate representation of what I aimed to acheive, I did look into adding some new mechasnics into the game but felt that this was a bit beyond my scope. This did not turn out well and had to revert back to what I had originally.
3. I feel changing from just JS to React was quite the challenge, although it brings out more possibilities and better functionality, it was difficult to get out of some of the habits I had developed over the past few weeks.
